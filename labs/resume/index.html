                    <p>I've taught the following courses: Core Compentency, Fundamentals of Mathematics I and II,
                        College Algebra,
                        Trigonometry, Finite Mathematics, Business Calculus, and Calculus 1, 2, and 3. I also helped put
                        together
                        our lighboard project. It allows us to film math youtube videos while writing on a large piece
                        of glass. My
                        job was to script, film, and edit the videos.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'v used MyMathLab, WebAssign, and ALEKS in a variety of courses. </p>
                    <p>I love motifivating the students by including historical reasons of why we are doing what we're
                        doing, how previous generations used this math, and how we use it today.</p>

                    <p>I focus primarily on the statistics courses here. I like to include a lot of Excel (or
                        equivalent) work in this class. It lets me
                        show the students how we can handle and analyze large amounts of data. I also have them work on
                        a final project that takes them through
                        the whole process of data analysis, starting from creating a survey, wording, visual
                        representation of the results, and hypothesis testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>They also give a final presentation. It gives them a chance to practice explaining their
                        motiviation, goals, and organize / professionally display
                        results.

                    <p> I started making YouTube videos around 2010. My channel has a couple of hundred videos about
                        calculus, encryption/code-breaking, and finite mathematics. I made the videos to supplement my
                        in-class teaching. I continue to make them because they are fun to film and edit.
                        </p>
                    <p>I've always been interested in encryption and code-breaking. I helped run a math camp at NIU a
                        few years ago. My activities were all about encryption/code-breaking. The campers enjoyed it so
                        I created online encryption/decryption websites with YouTube videos on how to use them. They
                        include different substitution methods, Vigen√®re cipher, and RSA encryption. The RSA encryption
                        is cool because there's a lot of high-level math involved. </p>

                    <p>I worked with NIU Outreach on a couple of interesting projects. I helped design a series of
                        zombie themed ACT prep questions. I also filmed
                        solutions to some of these while in full zombie make up and costume. Though I think a lot of
                        that footage is sadly lost, a zombie image of me exists somewhere.</p>
                    <p>I also helped develop cryptography content for a few other of their projects. One was called NIU
                        Stemread. Local high school students were asked to read
                        the first Maze Runner book. My job was to give a talk on cryptography titled "Breaking the code
                        - adventures in cryptography" and give my take on the maze puzzle.
