            <h2>What did I use?</h2>
            <h3><a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a></h3>
            <p>I used the Phaser framework for all my web based on games. It's a javascript framework and is probably
                the
                best framework I've ever used. They have a fantastic community website full of free tutorials, examples,
                and documentation.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">TILED</a></h3>
            <p>Tiled is a free and open source, easy to use, and flexible level editor. Flexible Object Layers. Annotate
                the level with rectangles, ellipses or polygons. Place, resize and rotate tiles freely. (Wikipedia)</p>

            <h3><a href="https://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt.Org</a></h3>
            <p>Open Game Art is a media repository intended for use with free and open source software game projects,
                offering open content assets. Its purpose is to allow developers to easily replace programmer art with
                high-quality, appropriately licensed artwork. (Wikipedia)</p>

            <h3><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">xCode / Swift</a></h3>
            <p>Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment for macOS, used to develop software for macOS, iOS,
                iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.</p>

                    <h3>Adventures of Gloor</h3>
                    <p>My wife and I ran a weeklong game camp one summer. My role was to teach them how to make a
                        mario clone. We spent a few days learning javascript, objects, functions, etc. We used the
                        JavaScript framework called
                        Phaser. </p>
                    <p>We used a free 2D level editor called TILED. Each camper used
                        this to make two game levels using free level assets through OpenGameArt.org. </p>
                    <p>They came up with the name <b>Adventures of Gloor</b>.</p>

                    <h3>Extreme Tic Tac Toe</h3>
                    <p>Extreme tic-tac-toe (also known as super tic-tac-toe, strategic tic-tac-toe,
                        or Ultimate tic-tac-toe is a board game composed of nine tic-tac-toe
                        boards arranged in a 3 Ã— 3 grid. Players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe
                        boards until one of them wins in the larger tic-tac-toe board. Compared to traditional
                        tic-tac-toe, strategy in this game is conceptually more difficult and has proven more
                        challenging for computers. (Wikipedia)</p>
                    <p>Your opponents previous move dictates which board you're allowed to play in.</p>

                    <h3>Lights Out!</h3>
                    <p>Such a cool game! Your objective is to turn off all the lights. Clicking the light will toggle
                        the light on or off. BUT... it will also toggle off any adjacent lights. The basic board size is
                        3x3. I
                        programmed it to go as high as your screen will let it. </p>
                    <p>I wanted to find something for my students outside the typical math word problems that deals with
                        solving
                        a system of equations. Given any board size, you can set up a large system of equations to
                        generate a solution
                        to Lights Out.

                    <h3>Simplex Method App</h3>
                    <p>
                        Need to solve a linear programming problem? Finished using the Simplex Method but you're not
                        getting the right answer? One of the major drawbacks to the Simplex Method is you have to keep
                        track of a page full of tedious calculations AND choose the correct row operations. When you
                        first learn this technique it's hard to do both correctly.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Simplex Method involves using a sequence of "If/Thens" that lead you to the initial Simplex
                        Table. This app walks you through the set up and creates the initial table. From there you can
                        either use the method on your own or have it help you through Hints. Choose the operation and
                        the app will generate the new table for you. You get to focus solely on practicing and
                        experimenting.

                    <h3>Row Reduction App</h3>
                    <p>Need to solve a system of equations by row reducing? Finished row reducing but you're not getting
                        the right answer? One of the major drawbacks to row reduction (Gauss Jordan Elimination) is you
                        have to keep track of a page full of tedious calculations AND choose the correct row operations.
                        When you first learn this technique it's hard to do both correctly.
                    </p>
                    <p> Row reducing involves using three different elementary row operations. This app allows you to
                        work through (and choose) the row operations without having to do the actual calculations. You
                        get to focus solely on practicing and experimenting.</p>

                    <p>This app guides you through the row reducing process from start to finish. </p>

                    <h3>Infinite Runners</h3>
                    <p>I don't play infinite runners very often. The last one I played was Mr. Jump on my iPhone. After
                        sinking so many hours into that game I thought, "wouldn't it be crazy if you had to control two
                        infinite runners at the same time running different
                        randomly generated courses?" In my game you are controlling two "runners" trying to collect
                        coins and avoiding the walls. One key (up key or top half of mobile screen) controls the top
                        player. The bottom half (or down key) controls the bottom player. If the walls push you off
                        screen, your run is over.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the hardest things I remember doing is animating the rotation on the jump.  Since holding down the jump button means you jump higher, I had to figure out how to slow down the rotation so it lands nicely.</p>
