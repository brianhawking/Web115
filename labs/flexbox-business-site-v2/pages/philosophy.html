                You might think our stance is “have it done right.” That’s what most companies will sell you.
                They’ll
                sell you on their “quality.” <b>Not us.</b> We’ll get your dream built… as long as you don’t dream too
                big.
                And
                maybe add some flaws in that dream. For example, small gaps in the roof or cabinet doors that don’t
                quite close. Even if they end up with large gaps, we’ll supply a water bucket for no charge – minus
                the
                delivery fee and overnight international shipping. What other company would do that? Wait, I think I
                got
                off point.
            </p>

                Why do people buy used cars or shop at secondhand stores? They understand the value of money. The
                average person doesn’t have $500+ to spend on a new fancy car with all the unnecessary gadgets
                like
                power steering, seatbelts, or front airbags. You buy a new car for $500 just to drive it off the
                lot
                and lose 95% of its value? That’s crazy. Why buy a new $85 dress shirt when you can find one
                secondhand
                for $3.99? It may not be pretty but it will get the job done. You end up buying used because you
                know
                the price is right and the quality is “good enough” just to get by. And that’s our philosophy.

                While I was in training my instructors told me I can pass with a C. And even though they also said I
                could never run my own company or build anything someone would want, here I am running my own
                company
                and building stuff some people sort of want.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want something done and can’t afford the “quality” those other companies offer, then come
                check
                us out. It will be cheap, good enough, and most importantly… it will cheap.
