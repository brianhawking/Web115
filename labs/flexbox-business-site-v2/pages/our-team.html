                    <h2>Brian Veitch, Owner and CEO</h2>
                    <p>Brian’s spent the last 10 years doing odd jobs for friends and family. The payment was usually a
                        pizza or chocolate chip cookies. It wasn’t until the summer of 2020 did he realize he can make a
                        career out of it. The most common thing you’ll hear Brian say is “Eh. Good enough.” You may
                        think that’s a sign of a lack of quality, but he argues that’s why we can keep our prices so
                        cheap. </p>

                    <h2>Chuck Stump, CFO and Craftsman</h2>
                    <p>
                        Chuck’s been around for awhile. And at the age of 70 he’s still kicking. He loves the
                        tedious jobs
                        like cleaning carpets, holding the tools, and pointing out mistakes. He does his best work
                        when it’s
                        hidden. For example, he loves to show off his fantastic craftsmanship that, sadly, is in the
                        back of
                        a hallway closet. You need to move the jackets and household supplies to eventually see it.
                        When you
                        do, though, you’ll be impressed.

                    <h2>Adam Stump, Team Lead and Craftsman</h2>
                    <p>
                        Adam loves the job as long as he’s not the one planning it. “Just tell me when to show up
                        and I’ll
                        bring the beer… I mean water,” is one of his favorite sayings. He promises he only does that
                        a few
                        times and he’ll never operate heavy machinery. Although, that’s usually followed up by a
                        wink. Don’t
                        worry though. He claims he just has something in his eye.
