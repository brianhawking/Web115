                    <p>Prime numbers are pretty cool and usually a topic of discussion in your first pre-algebra class.
                        They
                        are numbers whose only factors are 1 and itself. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.
                        After
                        you
                        do the homework and take the quiz, you probably never hear the term again. That isn’t true for
                        certain
                        mathematicians. In fact, some mathematicians
                            devoted quite a bit of their research to studying
                            prime
                            numbers. One such number is the digitally delicate prime number. <span id="dots-1">...</span>  </p>
                        <span id="more-1">
                    <p>A digitally delicate prime number is a prime number that has the following characteristic: if
                        you
                        change
                        any of the digits in that prime number, it will no longer be prime. Take 17. If I change the
                        7
                        to a
                        9 I
                        get 19 (which is still prime). So even though 17 is prime, it’s not digitally delicate. The
                        smallest
                        digitally delicate prime is 294,001. Change any of its digits to something else and you
                        still
                        won’t
                        get
                        a prime.</p>

                    <p>You might be thinking, “So? What’s the point?” Here’s the thing about some branches of
                        mathematics.
                        We
                        like to study it. We come up with interesting questions just to see if we can answer them.
                        There
                        may
                        not
                        be an immediate use for this knowledge. It’s just a series of puzzles. In the 1970s, the
                        mathematician
                        Murray Klamkin was curious if such numbers existed. Why? Who knows. The question was stated
                        and
                        put
                        out
                        into the universe for someone to answer. Maybe sometime in the future these numbers will
                        play a
                        role
                        in
                        something incredible.</p>

                    <p>Two parts iced tea one part lemonade, is what we today call an Arnold Palmer. It’s unlikely
                        Arnold
                        Palmer ‘invented’ the drink. I’m sure somewhere someone mixed the two much like how kids mix a
                        variety of sodas. But without Arnold Palmer the drink would probably not be as popular as it is
                        today <span id="dots-2">...</span></p>

                    <span id="more-2">
                        <p>Arnold Palmer is quoted by the Washington post as saying “My wife made a lot of iced tea for
                            lunch,
                            and I said, ‘Hey, babe, I’ve got an idea. You make the iced tea and make a big pitcher, and
                            we’ll
                            just put a little lemonade in it and see how that works.’ We mixed it up, and I got the
                            solution
                            about where I wanted it and I put the lemonade in it. I had it for lunch after working on
                            the
                            golf
                            course.” </p>
                        <p>Whenever he ordered the drink at the club he’d ask for iced tea with a third lemonade.
                            Someone
                            sitting nearby heard the order and asked for that “Arnold Palmer” drink. I find it so
                            interesting
                            that this small exchange gave birth to this drink. </p>

                    <p>This story, sadly, is not funny nor entertaining. Nonetheless it’s one I’d like to share. Without
                        the
                        movie The Imitation Game most would never have known the name Alan Turing. I did a history
                        project
                        back in high school about how encryption and deception was used during WWII <span
                            id="dots-3">...</span> </p>

                    <span id="more-3">
                        <p>Even my teacher knew very little of the history of the Enigma Machine and the man who’s
                            credited
                            for
                            cracking it. Even less knew that Polish cryptologists broke the initial Enigma. Germany
                            added
                            additional levels of complexity that eventually led them to contact British Military
                            Intelligence.

                        <p>This isn’t about the success of Alan Turing. It’s about his tragic ending. In 1952 Alan
                            Turing
                            was
                            arrested for homosexuality. It was illegal in Britain at the time. He was sentenced to 12
                            months
                            of
                            hormone therapy. A year after he completed his sentence, he was found dead from Cyanide
                            poisoning.
                            It was ruled a suicide. Some say it was due to his treatment because he was gay. Other’s
                            suggest
                            it
                            was simply an accident. Nonetheless, due to his arrest in 1952 he was no longer able to work
                            for
                            Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters. </p>
                        <p>Even though he was able to successfully work outside the government I find it terribly tragic
                            how
                            his
                            life ended. His work during WWII was classified. His contributions to ending the war were
                            not
                            known
                            at this time. Not only did he study mathematics, cryptography, philosophy, but he also
                            studied
                            what
                            we now call computer science and artificial intelligence. Where would we be in these areas
                            today
                            had
                            Alan Turing be able to continue his work? </p>

                where to reinforce the planes so they'd lose less to gunfire. He pointed to a relatively bullethole free
