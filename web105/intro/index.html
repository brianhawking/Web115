        <h1>Hi, my name is Brian Veitch!</h1>
        <h2>Here's some stuff about me</h2>
        <p>I've been a math teacher for the last 15 years.  In those years I've dabbled in web design
            and programming.  If I wanted to do something (like build an app or my personal website) 
            I'd watch a bunch of YouTube and learn enough
            to get my project done.  But this caused many gaps in my knowledge.  I enrolled in the <a href="https://www.mchenry.edu">McHenry County College</a> 
            mobile design and development program to fill in those gaps and get a solid foundation of web
            and app design.
