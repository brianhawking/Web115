    <p>The Name of the Wind is the first book in the KingKiller Chronicles written by Patrick 
        Rothfuss.  It follows a boy named Kvothe who grows up to be one of the most well known 
        and powerful wizards.  Present day Kvothe, now known as Kote, is a bar owner and fugitive
         for the murder of a king.  No one in town knows who he is.  But one day he is approached by a 
         chronicler (knowing who Kote really is) asks if he would tell his story.

    <h2>Kvothe</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>Kvothe is the main character who is telling the chronicler of this life starting from boyhood to his time 
    at the university.  As a child Kvothe was part of a traveling and extremely talented musical group. One day his entire family is murdered.  As an orphan
    he survives only by being clever.  He eventually makes his way to the university (which is very selective).  As an orphan
    he can not pay his tuition but secures a job as a musician in the local inn to pay his bills.  Music plays
    a large role in Kvothe's story.</p>
    <p>The rest of the story follows
    his relationships with fellow students, his love interest, and teachers.  We know through the present day 
    Kvothe (i.e., Kote) that he is expelled and eventually murders a king.  We don't know why or how
    this happens.  Many clues are given about his future, a conspiracy involving his family, and secrets within
    the university.  Sadly these won't be answered until the sequels.

    <h3>Scene where Kvothe plays music again.</h3>
    <p>Patrick Rothfull's writing is <strong>beautiful.</strong>   
        He spends so long writing his books because every word chosen is on purpose, literally 
        every word. Kvothe had a tragic childhood with the death of his family and music troop.  
        The following is an excerpt from the book when
        Kvothe finally picks up his instrument and plays again.</p>
    <br>  
    <p>
    <q><strong>The strings felt strange against my fingers, like reunited friends how have forgotten what they have
        in common.  I played soft and slow, sending notes no farther than the circle of our firelight. Fingers
        and strings made a careful conversation, as if their dance described the lines of an infatuation. Then I
        felt something inside me break and music began to pour out in the quiet.  My fingers dance; intricate and 
        quick they spun something gossamer and tremulous into the circle of the light our fire had made.  The 
        music moved like a spiderweb stirred by a gentle breath, it changed like a leaf twisting as it falls 
        to the ground.</strong>
