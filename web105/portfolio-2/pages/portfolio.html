                <p>
                    I started making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brianveitch">YouTube videos</a> around 2010. My
                    channel has a couple of hundred videos
                    about calculus, encryption/code-breaking, and finite mathematics. I made the videos
                    to supplement my in-class teaching. I continue to make them because they are fun to
                    film and edit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've always been interested in encryption and code-breaking. I helped run a math camp
                    at NIU a few years ago. My activities were all about encryption/code-breaking. The
                    campers enjoyed it so I created online encryption/decryption websites</a> with YouTube
                    videos on how to use them. They include different <a
                        href="http://www.brianveitch.com/maze-runner/">substitution</a> methods,
                    <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/maze-runner/vigenere/index.html">Vigen√®re</a>
                    cipher, and RSA encryption. The <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/cryptography/rsa.php">RSA
                        encryption</a>
                    is cool because there's a lot of high-level math involved.

                    One of my biggest YouTube videos is on the Simplex Method (around 400,000 views). Since my
                    students also struggle with this method, I decided to create two apps to help teach
                    these techniques.

                    <img src="../images/simplexicon.png" class="boxless" alt="Simplex Method app icon">
                    <p>This is called the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/simplex-method/id1496635032">Simplex
                            Method</a>,
                        and it helps solve systems
                        of linear inequalities (ie., linear programming). It's important to note that they DO NOT just
                        solve the
                        problems. I programmed it to let you practice the technique, make mistakes, and
                        learn from them. I included a hint option to help when you get stuck.  The first hint will be instructions on what 
                        you should do. The second and third hints will be more specific to your current situation.

                        and it helps students solve systems
                        of equations. Normally you learn to solve a system of two equations / two variables using the
                        substitution
                        method or the addition method. Row reduction can solve these as well as much larger systems of
                        equations. Like the Simplex Method app I programmed it to let you practice, make mistakes, and learn from 
                    them. </p>

                <p>
                    This was one of the first games I made. When learning to program, I followed tutorials
                    on how to make a <a href="http://brianveitch.com/games/simple-ttt/">simple tic tac toe</a> game
                    using JavaScript. Afterward, I wanted to make
                    an <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/games/tictactoe/">Extreme Tic Tac Toe</a> game. It involves
                    two players trying to win the large Tic Tac
                    Toe board by competing to win the smaller boards. The difficulty is when a player
                    chooses a square in the small board the other player must move to the corresponding
                    large square and play that board. You must try to work out a few moves ahead to try
                    to force the second player to move you where you want.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was trying to figure out some real-world applications to solve a system of equations.
                    Though there are many, very few are fun. <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/lights-out/">Lights
                        out</a> is a children's game where you click a
                    circle to turn on or off that light. However, all adjacent lights will also turn on
                    or off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The feature that I share with my students is the solution option. It will indicate which
                    lights must be pressed to successfully turn off all the lights. It involves solving
                    a massive system of equations. For example, a 3x3 grid requires us to solve a system
                    with 9 equations and 9 variables. An 11x11 grid requires us to solve a system of
                    equations with 121 equations and 121 variables. The hardest system we teach in any
                    algebra class is 3 equations and 3 variables. So imagine how hard 121 equations/variables
                    would be.
