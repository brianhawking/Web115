                    When I have more time in the summer, I like to build stuff. Sometimes I build for
                    family and friends, like the planter above. Sometimes I just build things that look
                    cool. I saw a picture of a unique chessboard, and I decided to build it for myself. You can see
                    the picture of what I built in the board games section.
                    A lot of times I just build things to see if I can do it.
                </p>

                    Instead of buying the product, I get to spend time building with my father-in-law and
                    my son. My son loves to help, and I look forward to teaching him more.

                    My family and I are avid board gamers. However, it is difficult to find games we all
                    enjoy. For example, my favorite board game is chess. No one in my family plays or
                    wants to learn. We generally stick to cooperative board games like Forbidden Island,
                    Pandemic, etc. We are quite competitive so playing a cooperative game means we all
                    win or all lose. It saves us from the normal ending I'm sure we've all experienced
                    while playing Monopoly - someone flipping the board over and stomping off.
                    Occasionally we'll play competitive games like Settlers of Catan, Lords of
                    Waterdeep, or Qwirckle.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Reading</h2>

                <p>
                    After I get my work done, do my homework, and put the kids to bed, I finally have
                    time to read. My favorite genre is Fantasy. In my senior year of high school, we
                    did a unit on Lord of the Rings. I fell in love with that book and the genre. My
                    favorites are the KingKiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss and anything written by
                    Brandon Sanderson.
