                Hi, my name is Brian Veitch. I am a math instructor at Northern Illinois University and McHenry
                County College. At NIU I am 1
                the director of the department's Mathematics Assistance
                Center. I primarily teach our calculus sequence as well as coordinate the finite mathematics
                course. At MCC I usually teach statistics courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also done some additional teaching outside the classroom. A few years ago, I helped
                run a summer math camp where I taught them about encryption and code-breaking. I also
                worked with NIU Outreach with a program called Stem Read. I showed them how mathematics,
                puzzles, and encryption were used. The first one I did was Maze Runner. I designed an
                activity about code-breaking. And showed them how you can overlay images (such as mazes) to
                form words or codes.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started taking classes at McHenry County College in the Mobile App Design and Development
                program at MCC. My goal is to get a job in mobile or web development. Over the last
                few years, I've developed a couple of iOS apps and JavaScript programs to help my
                students in the classroom. You can check those out in the <a href="pages/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>
                section.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm currently taking iOS programming, UI Design, and web design (this class).

                <p>
                    I am married to a wonderful person and have two boys, ages 1 and 4. When I am not
                    teaching, grading, doing homework, or attending classes I am spending time with them.
                    We like to play board games, go for bike rides, and engage in all sorts of
                    shenanigans that annoy their mother.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My 4 year old loves to read books. We read about 6 books throughout the day. Saturdays
                    are our adventure days. We go for walks, ride bikes, visit the zoo, play outside. On Sunday
                    we get to relax with a fun movie and eat popcorn.
