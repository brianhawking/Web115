                    I started making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/brianveitch">YouTube videos</a> around 2010. My channel has a couple of hundred videos
                    about calculus, encryption/code-breaking, and finite mathematics. I made the videos
                    to supplement my in-class teaching. I continue to make them because they are fun to
                    film and edit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've always been interested in encryption and code-breaking. I helped run a math camp
                    at NIU a few years ago. My activities were all about encryption/code-breaking. The
                    campers enjoyed it so I created online encryption/decryption websites</a> with YouTube
                    videos on how to use them. They include different <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/maze-runner/">substitution</a> methods, 
                    <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/maze-runner/vigenere/index.html">Vigen√®re</a>
                    cipher, and RSA encryption. The <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/cryptography/rsa.php">RSA encryption</a>
                     is cool because there's a lot of high-level math involved.

                    One of my biggest YouTube videos is on the Simplex Method (around 400,000 views). Since my
                    students also struggle with this method, I decided to create two apps to help teach
                    these techniques. One is called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/tt/app/row-reduction/id1493366757">Row Reduction</a>,
                     and it helps students solve systems
                    of equations. The second is called the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/simplex-method/id1496635032">Simplex Method</a>,
                     and it helps solve systems
                    of linear inequalities. It's important to note that they DO NOT just solve the
                    problems. I programmed it to let you practice the technique, make mistakes, and
                    learn from them. I included a hint option to help when you get stuck.

                <p>
                    This was one of the first games I made. When learning to program, I followed tutorials
                    on how to make a <a href="http://brianveitch.com/games/simple-ttt/">simple tic tac toe</a> game using JavaScript. Afterward, I wanted to make
                    an <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/games/tictactoe/">Extreme Tic Tac Toe</a> game. It involves two players trying to win the large Tic Tac
                    Toe board by competing to win the smaller boards. The difficulty is when a player
                    chooses a square in the small board the other player must move to the corresponding
                    large square and play that board. You must try to work out a few moves ahead to try
                    to force the second player to move you where you want.

                        I was trying to figure out some real-world applications to solve a system of equations.
                        Though there are many, very few are fun. <a href="http://www.brianveitch.com/lights-out/">Lights out</a> is a children's game where you click a
                        circle to turn on or off that light. However, all adjacent lights will also turn on
                        or off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The feature that I share with my students is the solution option. It will indicate which
                        lights must be pressed to successfully turn off all the lights. It involves solving
                        a massive system of equations. For example, a 3x3 grid requires us to solve a system
                        with 9 equations and 9 variables. An 11x11 grid requires us to solve a system of
                        equations with 121 equations and 121 variables. The hardest system we teach in any
                        algebra class is 3 equations and 3 variables. So imagine how hard 121 equations/variables
                        would be.
