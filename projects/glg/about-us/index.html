                    <p>Emily Coklan is the guild’s flinger of idea spaghetti and teacher-minded skeptic. A resume
                        covering LA/Literature instruction as well as LMC direction prior to settling into the
                        instructional coaching groove has instilled a love for fast research and the tendency to use too
                        many words and punctuation marks. Outside the professional realm, Emily is a very tired twin and
                        dog mom who loves reading, biking, arranging flowers, and pretending her kitchen is a Food
                        Network show. Follow Emily on Twitter @TechCoachEm</p>

                    <p>Jenni LaBrie is the Grounded Learners Guild’s “clarified butter”, streamlining and enhancing
                        every idea the guild cooks up with intentional questioning and thoughtful revision. Jenni’s
                        trajectory has seen her delivering 13 years of high school Spanish instruction, evolving into a
                        trailblazer in tech integration and blended learning, and finally planting both feet firmly in
                        the world of instructional coaching and adult learning. The patience and optimism she has
                        brought to the guild and her many instructional roles also serve her well as a mom of three
                        kids.
                        In whatever spare time remains in LaBrie land, Jenni stays “grounded” by practicing yoga with
                        regularity, and singing karaoke-style during commutes. Follow Jenni on Twitter @jennilabrie</p>

                    <p>Casey Veitch is “La Capitana” and idea machine that keeps the wheels of the Grounded Learners
                        Guild turning with fresh content and an ever-present ability to make cogent connections. She
                        brings a decade of high school English instruction to the collective guild street cred in
                        addition to an ever growing professional library that she can sometimes even quote verbatim.
                        When not coaching or dreaming up professional learning notions, Casey is a mom of two boys who
                        will binge watch anything streamable, probably while making things out of yarn and designing
                        hilarious swag to Cricut. Follow Casey on Twitter @Cveitcher</p>
